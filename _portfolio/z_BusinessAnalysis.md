My final project for Business Analysis course (6 ECTS) consisted of developing a comprehensive Business Analysis Report for an Italian company, aimed at identifying a business need and problem and proposing an IT-intensive solution that delivers measurable value. The report is the culmination of the skills and concepts covered throughout the course and serves as a demonstration of the ability to apply business analysis practices in a real-world context.
Project Objectives:

* Analyze the current state of a business process, system, and strategic approach within the chosen company.

* Identify a specific need, problem, and opportunity that can be addressed through an IT-related solution.

* Engage in stakeholder analysis to understand user needs and constraints.

* Apply data gathering techniques (interviews, document analysis, surveys) to collect relevant input.

* Define and assess improvement options, including architectural and feasibility analysis.

* Conduct a risk assessment associated with the proposed solutions.

* Develop and justify a business case, showing how the solution aligns with the companyâ€™s goals and delivers business value.
