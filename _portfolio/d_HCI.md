During the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design course, I worked on a project focused on developing a website for comparing second-hand book prices in Estonia. This project followed a user-centered design approach, incorporating competitor analysis, stakeholder interviews, and user research to identify key challenges and opportunities. I contributed to the creation of personas and user scenarios, helping to shape design decisions based on real user needs. Using affinity diagrams, I helped organize and analyze user feedback to refine the concept. I participated in designing and developing low, medium, and high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring an intuitive and efficient interface. Additionally, I conducted user evaluations to assess usability, gather insights, and iterate on design improvements. This project enhanced my skills in HCI methodologies, user research, and prototyping, providing hands-on experience in designing an effective and user-friendly digital platform.
