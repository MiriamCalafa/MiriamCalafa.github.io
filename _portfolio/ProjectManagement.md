During the Project Management course, I worked on a project focused on developing a robot study companion for university students. I contributed to writing a comprehensive project proposal, which included a practical outline, budget analysis, and evaluation of coursematesâ€™ proposals. Throughout the course, I actively participated in a project simulation, attending a kick-off meeting, submitting work package reports, and presenting the final project demonstration. This experience provided valuable hands-on knowledge of project management methodologies, team coordination, budgeting, and evaluation processes, reinforcing my ability to manage and execute complex projects efficiently.
