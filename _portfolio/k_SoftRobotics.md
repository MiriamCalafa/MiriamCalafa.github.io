Bioimpedance analysis is a noninvasive and cost-effective method widely used for measuring body composition and assessing clinical conditions. Numerous techniques are employed to interpret bioimpedance data, and it has a broad range of applications in body composition estimation and clinical evaluation.
This case study investigates the detection of muscle fatigue through bioimpedance measurements, focusing on the impact of acidosis induced by intense physical exercise. Using a model system composed of a banana peel and an acidic reservoir layer, bioimpedance changes were monitored during different phases simulating muscle rest, exercise, and fatigue. The results demonstrate the influence of acidosis on muscle conductivity, with significant bioimpedance variations observed between the different experimental setups. These findings offer insights into the potential application of bioimpedance as a non-invasive method for assessing muscle fatigue and its underlying chemical changes.
