During my time at Microstudio srl, I worked in the R&D department on developing a warehouse control and management system. My role involved programming in C# and SQL, analyzing the existing system, and optimizing warehouse operations. The project required me to interview employees to understand their needs, study the Panthera database, and define the appâ€™s functionalities. I followed an iterative development cycle, continuously implementing, releasing new versions, and gathering feedback. Additionally, I created comprehensive documentation to ensure that future developers could maintain and expand the system.
