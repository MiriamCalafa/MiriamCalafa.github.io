At Microstudio, I conducted a cost analysis by examining the working time of different employees on various machines and comparing the results with standard or hypothesized times. This process involved both an investigative phase to gather relevant data and a mathematical analysis performed in Excel. By identifying discrepancies between actual and expected working times, I was able to determine which machinery incurred higher costs and which departments operated with greater efficiency. This analysis provided valuable insights into resource allocation and process optimization, contributing to a better understanding of operational costs and efficiency improvements.
