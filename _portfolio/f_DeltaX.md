I participated in the DeltaX competition, a multidisciplinary engineering challenge at the University of Tartu, where teams developed innovative technological solutions. As part of this competition, I worked on a hands-on robotics and automation project, applying my knowledge in robotics, AI, and control systems to design and implement a functional solution.  

My contributions included:  
* System design and development, assisting in the conceptualization and implementation of the project by integrating robotics and automation principles.  
* Programming and algorithm implementation, working on coding and optimizing control algorithms to enhance system performance.  
* Problem-solving and team collaboration, tackling challenges in system efficiency, sensor integration, and real-time decision-making alongside a diverse team.  
* Project presentation and documentation, contributing to reports and presentations to showcase our work to judges and the academic community.  

This experience strengthened my technical expertise, teamwork, and problem-solving skills while allowing me to apply engineering principles in a real-world, competitive setting. DeltaX provided a valuable opportunity to innovate, collaborate, and push the boundaries of robotics and automation.
