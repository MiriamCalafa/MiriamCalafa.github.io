During the Machine Learning course, I worked on a group project analyzing student performance data using machine learning techniques. The dataset included detailed records of quiz and homework attempts, final scores, and self-reported skill levels. My task involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to predict student grades based on their engagement and performance throughout the semester.  

I explored patterns in student attempts, considering the impact of repeated submissions and early participation. Using both descriptive and predictive analytics, I applied machine learning models to classify students' final grades and identify key factors influencing success. The analysis required handling missing data, evaluating model performance, and refining predictive accuracy.  

In addition to predictive modeling, we applied clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of students based on their learning habits. By analyzing patterns in quiz and homework attempts, submission timing, and overall engagement, we classified students into different learning profiles. This helped uncover behavioral trends, such as frequent early submitters, last-minute learners, and high-effort improvers.
