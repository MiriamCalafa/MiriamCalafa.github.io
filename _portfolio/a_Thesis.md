This thesis explores the role of emotional expressivity in robotic study companions (RSCs) and its impact on the learning experience of university students. While previous research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has primarily focused on younger students, this study addresses the gap in university-level educational robotics, where emotional engagement and adaptive support are essential for academic success.  

A digital twin of the Robot Study Companion (RSC), originally developed by Farnaz Baksh, was designed and implemented using ROS2 to facilitate further enhancements in emotional expression. This digital twin provided a simulation environment for refining multimodal interactions, enabling improvements in the robot’s facial expressions, gestures, colors, and speech capabilities to better align with human emotional perception.  

To evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancements, a cross-cultural study was conducted with university students. The study aimed to assess how different cultures interpret and respond to robotic emotions and whether the multimodal expressions successfully conveyed the intended emotional states.  

The key achievements of this research include the development of a digital twin of the RSC using ROS2, allowing for scalable testing and refinement of emotional expressivity. The multimodal emotional communication of the RSC was improved by refining its facial expressions, gestures, colors, and speech-based interactions. A cross-cultural study was conducted, validating the effectiveness of the robot’s emotional expressions across diverse student backgrounds. The research demonstrated that multimodal emotional expression contributes to higher engagement, reduced academic stress, and improved study motivation among university students. It also identified key differences in emotional perception across cultures, offering insights for designing adaptive, culturally aware robotic companions.  

These findings contribute to the broader discussion on emotion-driven HRI and highlight the potential of emotionally expressive robots in supporting university students' academic journeys. The research paves the way for future improvements in social robotic design, ensuring that study companions are not only functional but also engaging and emotionally supportive learning partners.
