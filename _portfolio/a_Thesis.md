## Thesis Overview

My MSc thesis, “Designing Multimodal Emotional Expression for a Robotic Study Companion,” explores how affective robotics can support student motivation, well-being, and learning. Grounded in a theoretical review of affective feedback in educational settings, the project identifies six core emotions: Anger, Joy, Pride, Fun, Surprise, and Caring, each tied to pedagogical functions.

To prototype and test these emotional expressions, I developed a fully functional ROS 2-based digital twin of the Robot Study Companion (RSC), enabling rapid iteration and simulation. The emotional model integrates synchronized modalities, color, motion, facial expression, and voice, to create cohesive, recognizable responses.

Evaluation involved a cross-cultural, video-based user study with 47 participants. Recognition accuracy for emotional valence exceeded 95%, with an overall emotion-recognition rate of 58.16%. Results from the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were strongly positive, especially in the dimensions of Perspicuity and Attractiveness. Semi-structured interviews further validated the design's impact and identified paths for refinement. Notably, cross-group analyses revealed significant variation by gender, academic level, and nationality, highlighting the potential for adaptive, personalized emotional profiles in future implementations.

All software developed is open-source and contributes a robust platform for continued exploration of emotional expressivity in human–robot interaction.
