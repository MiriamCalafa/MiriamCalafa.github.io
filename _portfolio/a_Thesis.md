## Abstract
This thesis investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of the emotional expression
of the Robot Study Companion (RSC) intended to support university students’ motivation, well-being, and learning outcomes.

Guided by a theoretical review of affective feedback in educational robotics, we identified six
target emotions: Anger, Joy, Pride, Fun, Surprise, and Caring, each linked to educationally
meaningful functions. We developed a fully functional digital twin of the RSC in ROS 2 to
enable rapid prototyping and simulation, and built a modular emotional expression that coordinates color, motion, facial expression, and vocal behavior for each emotional response.
To assess recognition accuracy and user experience, we conducted a video-based cross-cultural
study with 47 participants. Participants distinguished positive versus negative valence with over
95% accuracy, and achieved an overall emotion-recognition rate of 58.16%. User Experience
Questionnaire (UEQ) results were consistently positive, with Perspicuity and Attractiveness
rated highest. Qualitative interviews highlighted the strengths of our multimodal design as well
as opportunities for refinement. Cross-group analyses revealed systematic differences by gender, academic level, and nationality, underscoring the need for adaptive, personalized emotion
profiles.

All software developed in this work is released open-source, providing a robust foundation for
future research in affective human–robot interaction within educational settings
