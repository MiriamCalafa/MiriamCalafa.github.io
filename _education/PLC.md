During this course, I developed a strong foundation in PLC programming, ladder logic, and HMI development, acquiring both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in industrial automation systems.  

Key skills:

* PLC Programming & Ladder Logic – Learned to write structured PLC programs from scratch, using various ladder logic instructions to create functional automation sequences.  

* Signal Processing – Gained a clear understanding of digital vs. analog signals, learning how to acquire, process, and output data efficiently in a PLC system.  

* Industrial Control Techniques – Implemented standard control methods such as HOA (Hand-Off-Auto) control, level control, pump control, and introductory PID loops for automation processes.  

* Alarm & Notification Systems** – Designed alarm logic and notification programming, ensuring safety, usability, and operator awareness in industrial environments.  

* HMI Development – Explored the fundamentals of Human-Machine Interface (HMI) design, gaining a practical understanding of how to develop and integrate HMI programs for real-world applications.
