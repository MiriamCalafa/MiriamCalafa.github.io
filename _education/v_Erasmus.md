As part of my B.Sc. in Automation Engineering, I spent a semester abroad at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM), the most prestigious engineering university in Spain.  

During this experience, I expanded my technical expertise by studying advanced engineering subjects in a highly competitive academic environment. I engaged in international collaboration, working with students from diverse backgrounds on automation and robotics projects. This opportunity strengthened my adaptability and problem-solving skills as I navigated new academic and cultural challenges. Additionally, I enhanced my language proficiency, developing communication skills in a multilingual and international context.  

This Erasmus semester at UPM was a key milestone in my academic journey, reinforcing my passion for automation, robotics, and global collaboration while providing me with a broader perspective on engineering education and innovation.
