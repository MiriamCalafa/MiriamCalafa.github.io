Additional coursework I completed at Politecnico di Milano after graduating, earning 30 extra ECTS credits to deepen my expertise in robotics, automation, and management.

The courses covered a range of advanced topics, focusing on both theoretical foundations and practical applications. I gained specialized knowledge in robotics control, planning, and localization, along with insights into production system optimization and agile project management. Additionally, I explored team dynamics and leadership, strengthening my ability to work effectively in collaborative environments.
