Hi, I’m Miriam Calafa, a recent cum laude graduate in Robotics and Computer Engineering from the University of Tartu (GPA: 4.95), holding a B.Sc. in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. My work bridges robotics, software development, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and system integration, with a strong foundation in engineering and a passion for human-centered design.

I excel in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I bring a proactive mindset, strong organizational skills, and a commitment to continuous improvement. My hands-on experience spans robotic prototyping, R&D, and full-stack system integration, particularly with ROS2, Python, and C++. My thesis focused on designing a multimodal digital twin for a robotic study companion, exploring emotional expressivity to foster deeper engagement in HRI.

Beyond technical skills, I’ve cultivated leadership and project management expertise through specialized coursework and cross-functional teamwork. As a Python tutor and teaching assistant, I’ve honed the ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and effectively.

Outside the lab, I’m a dedicated long-distance runner, embracing the values of discipline, resilience, and goal-oriented growth that I carry into every aspect of my academic and professional life.
