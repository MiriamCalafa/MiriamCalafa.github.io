Hi, I’m Miriam, an enthusiastic Robotics and Computer Engineering student at the University of Tartu, soon to graduate. I hold a B.Sc. in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, and my passion lies at the intersection of technology, robotics, and management.

I thrive in dynamic environments, bringing energy, spontaneity, and strong organizational skills to every project. As a fast learner with a keen problem-solving mindset, I have developed hands-on experience in social robotics, AI, and Python programming.

Beyond engineering, I am deeply passionate about management and leadership, valuing effective communication and strategic decision-making. Outside of academics, I’m a dedicated athlete, particularly in running, where I embrace discipline, resilience, and continuous improvement—values I also apply to my professional journey.
