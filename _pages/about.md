Hi, I’m Miriam, a soon-to-graduate Robotics and Computer Engineering student at the University of Tartu with a B.Sc. in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. My passion lies in the intersection of robotics, software development, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and system integration.

I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments, bringing energy, organization, and a proactive problem-solving mindset to every project. With hands-on experience in ROS2, Python, C++, and complex system integration, I have worked extensively in robotic prototyping, R&D, and software development. My thesis research focuses on developing a digital twin for a robotic study companion, emphasizing multimodal emotional expressivity to enhance human-robot interactions.

Beyond engineering, I am passionate about project management and leadership, having completed multiple management courses and collaborated on cross-functional projects. My experience as a Python tutor and teaching assistant has strengthened my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively.

Outside of academics, I am a dedicated athlete and long-distance runner, embracing discipline, resilience, and continuous improvement—values that also shape my professional and academic journey.
